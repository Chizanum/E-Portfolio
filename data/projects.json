I gained hands-on experience structuring backend APIs, handling client–server communication with Axios, and managing data flow between the frontend and database. I also improved my understanding of component-based architecture, asynchronous operations, and error handling, while using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and Lucide React to create a consistent and user-friendly interface. Overall, the project helped me understand how real-world applications are designed, built, and debugged across both frontend and backend layers.",
